## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to the National Basketball Association or the a NBA team like the Portland Trail Blazers. I am thinking about potentially looking at ranking Blazers players based on their stats. I could also looking into ranking NBA players based off their "clutchness." I could also look into projecting who is going to win the next NBA championship based on several stats relating to players and other advanced statistics.
